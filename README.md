# Neural Network from Scratch

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, built from scratch using NumPy. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the core principles of neural networks, including forward propagation, backward propagation, cost calculation, and parameter optimization.

## Features

- **Activation Functions**: Sigmoid and ReLU
- **Cost Function**: Cross-entropy loss
- **Optimization Algorithm**: Gradient Descent
- **Training Process**: Forward and backward propagation

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and NumPy. You can install the necessary package using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
